The haunted mansion

We were heading to the haunted mansion in the forest.
There was talk in the town about some misterious disappearence.
But yesterday we found the mauled body of farmer Benson so we headed out to investigate.

The mansion itself had always been part of this town's history.
Build in 1805 with over twenty chambers, it was fit for a noble.

Now, it was decripit, rotten and infested by vermin. We were nerveous about what we might find inside.

We heard some noises, it sounded like some kind of animal
A four-legged animal, probably....
But when approaching the entrance, we noticed it was a human, just not a regular human.. It was a werewolf!

His fur was all in blood, his eyes were of fluorescent green. I still remember the grin of his fangs.
The werewolf could speak human language and said: "Follow me, I will introduce you to my Master".

We were paralyzed and could mumble nothing but 'yyyeah'. 
Trustworthy as we are, we followed the werewolf. 
Anxious thoughts were racing through our minds.
Where will he bring us? Will we ever make it out Alive?
