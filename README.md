The haunted mansion

We were heading to the haunted mansion in the forest.
There was talk in the town about some misterious disappearence.
But yesterday we found the mauled body of farmer Benson so we headed out to investigate.

The mansion itself had always been part of this town's history.
Build in 1805 with over twenty chambers, it was fit for a noble.
Now, it was decripit, rotten and infested by vermin. We were nerveous about what we might find inside.  

We could not open the door and went in through the broken window in the basement.  
We were dumbfounded: there were cellars along the long corridor.  
Souds of tortures and human suffering, voice of a crying baby came from the cellars... I asked my friend if he also hears it.
